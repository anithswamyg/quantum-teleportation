# Quantum Teleportation with Qiskit

This project demonstrates quantum teleportation — transferring an unknown qubit state from one location to another using entanglement and classical communication.

## Goals
• Build and simulate a teleportation circuit  
• Measure fidelity between original and teleported qubits  
• Run the experiment on IBM real quantum hardware  

## Theory in Simple Words
Quantum teleportation does not move particles.  
It moves the *information* (the quantum state) using:
1. Entanglement
2. Bell measurement
3. Two classical bits of communication

## Code
Teleportation implementation using Qiskit (Coming in next commit)
